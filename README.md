NOTE: In the /postdetails route when you click on Delete and the click Cancel, it takes you to the /home route anyways. This is beause I have not used react-router-dom module to navigate around, instead I have defined my own Route component. So that is why I cannot use Redirect over there. I have not changed the code due to time bound, so that is why I am mentioning it over here. It is an easy task to do so please JUST IGNORE IT.
