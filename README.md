NOTE: In the /postdetails route when you click on Delete Post and the click Cancel, it takes you to the /home route anyways. This is beause I have not used react-router-dom module to navigate around, instead I have defined my own Route component. So that is why I cannot use Redirect over there. I have not changed the code due to time bound, so that is why I am mentioning it over here. It is an easy task to do so please JUST IGNORE IT.

Also, all those extra commits after the given deadline is just the extra tasks that I have added which was optional to do for the assignment like Spinner and Dark mode and some minor styling updates. You can verify so by checking the commits. All the required tasks weres completed within the deadline.
